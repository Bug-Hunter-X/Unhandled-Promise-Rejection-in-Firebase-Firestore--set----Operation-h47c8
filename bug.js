The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase related to the asynchronous nature of its operations and improper error handling.  This example focuses on a situation where a `set()` operation on a Firestore document isn't properly handled within a promise chain, resulting in unexpected behavior and potential data inconsistencies.  The missing `.catch()` block prevents error handling. 
```javascript
//Incorrect Code
firebase.firestore().collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').set({field: 'value'})
.then(() => {
  console.log('Data written successfully!');
});
```
