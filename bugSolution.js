The corrected code includes a `.catch()` block to handle any errors that might occur during the Firestore `set()` operation:
```javascript
//Corrected Code
firebase.firestore().collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').set({field: 'value'})
.then(() => {
  console.log('Data written successfully!');
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error writing document: ', error);
  //Further error handling, e.g., displaying an error message to the user
});
```
This improved version ensures that any exceptions during the `set()` operation are caught, logged to the console (for debugging), and potentially handled more gracefully within the application (e.g., displaying a user-friendly error message).  This prevents silent failures and ensures data integrity.
